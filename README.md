# RateMyProgram

A program-level equivalent of RateMyProfessor. Open-source, privacy-friendly, and anonymous.

## Why?

We need to keep departments accountable. There are too many instances of programs (and professors) abusing their positions of power or extracting extra labor from grad students. It is time that changes. This website is meant for hosting anonymous reviews of university programs. Privacy is preserved, and no personal details are collected. The website is not US-only.

## Contributing

Help is always appreciated! Please contribute via pull requests, detailing what the PR adds/fixes. Please try to use descriptive commit messages, and avoid messages such as "fix".

## Tech stack

The website is built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Style guidelines

There are not many style guidelines at the moment, but some basics apply:

* Indentation is using 4 spaces.
* Components belong in their own folder, with a `Component.js` and a `Component.sass` file at the minimum. If there is no styling necessary, perhaps it does not need to be a component at all?
